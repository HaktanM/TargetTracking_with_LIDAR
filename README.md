## TargetTracking_with_LIDAR
This is an implementation of ['A Cartesian B-Spline Vehicle Model for Extended Object Tracking'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8455717), which explores the utilization of B-spline-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation. I also provide my additional notes [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cbgfpjhtdcnf#236155). If you want to understand the implementation in detail, you can refer to my notes.

# Simulation with LIDAR
I provide a LIDAR simulator with a target moving on the scene.
